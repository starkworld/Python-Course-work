        Description: program that uses the US Census geocoding API (Links to an external site.)
        (access link for a full description of the API) to retrieve the location (latitude and longitude) of the U.S.
        White House (1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, DC) and that of your local residence,
        and compute the approximate distance, in miles, between the two locations.
